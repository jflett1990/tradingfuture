## üîç Detailed Bug Analysis

### Bug #1: Incorrect Market Structure Analysis
- **File**: `tradingagents/dataflows/futures_utils.py`
- **Issue**: Used absolute difference instead of ratio for trend calculation
- **Impact**: Misleading signals across different price levels
- **Fix**: Changed to ratio-based calculation for price-agnostic analysis

**Before:**
```python
market_trend = current_price - sma_20  # Wrong: absolute difference
```

**After:**
```python
market_trend = current_price / sma_20 if sma_20 > 0 else 1.0  # Correct: ratio
```

### Bug #2: Incorrect Position Sizing Calculation
- **File**: `tradingagents/dataflows/futures_utils.py`
- **Issue**: Wrong ATR usage, division by zero potential, no position limits
- **Impact**: Could risk entire account on single trade
- **Fix**: Proper ATR-based sizing with safety checks

**Before:**
```python
position_value = risk_amount / atr  # Wrong formula
contracts = int(position_value / contract_value)  # No limits
```

**After:**
```python
stop_distance = atr * atr_multiplier
contracts = int(risk_amount / (stop_distance * contract_value))  # Correct formula
contracts = min(contracts, max_contracts)  # With limits
```

### Bug #3: Missing Error Handling in Stop Loss
- **File**: `tradingagents/agents/risk_mgmt/futures_risk_manager.py`
- **Issue**: Silent failure on invalid position types
- **Impact**: Trades could execute without proper stop losses
- **Fix**: Comprehensive error handling with validation

**Before:**
```python
else:
    stop_loss = entry_price  # Wrong: silent failure
```

**After:**
```python
else:
    valid_types = ["long", "short"]
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid position_type '{position_type}'. Must be one of: {valid_types}")
```

### Bug #4: Division by Zero in Momentum Calculation
- **File**: `tradingagents/agents/trader/futures_trader.py`
- **Issue**: No validation before division operations
- **Impact**: Runtime crashes with invalid price data
- **Fix**: Safe calculation with input validation

**Before:**
```python
momentum = (data['Close'].iloc[-1] / data['Close'].iloc[-20]) - 1  # No validation
```

**After:**
```python
if previous_close <= 0 or pd.isna(previous_close):
    momentum = 0.0  # Safe default
else:
    momentum = (current_close / previous_close) - 1
```

### Bug #5: Contradictory Trading Logic
- **File**: `tradingagents/agents/trader/futures_trader.py`
- **Issue**: Strong uptrends generated short signals
- **Impact**: Systematic losses due to contrarian signals
- **Fix**: Consistent momentum-based logic

**Before:**
```python
if market_trend > 1.02:  # Strong uptrend
    direction = "short"  # Wrong: contrarian to uptrend
```

**After:**
```python
if market_trend > 1.02 and direction == "long":  # Strong uptrend confirmation
    confidence += 0.4  # Correct: same direction
```

### Bug #6: Memory Leak in Position Management
- **File**: `tradingagents/agents/trader/futures_trader.py`
- **Issue**: Positions dictionary grew indefinitely
- **Impact**: Memory exhaustion in long-running systems
- **Fix**: Proper position lifecycle management

**Before:**
```python
self.positions[trade_id] = position  # No cleanup
```

**After:**
```python
# Separate active and closed positions with cleanup
self.positions = {}  # Only active
self.closed_positions = {}  # Limited cache
self.trade_history = []  # Complete record
```
